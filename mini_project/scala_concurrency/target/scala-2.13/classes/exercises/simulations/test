REASONS:
1.  when multiple cpu's available
        ---> multiple caches shares memory
        ---> it is not true that all caches holds same value for every memory location
2.  context switching
        1 cpu
        multiple threads sharing a same variable
        sum = 0
        when t1 -> sum += 2
            t2 -> sum += 4
            t1 context switched after loading sum
            t2 executes its operation
            t1 executes its operation

when multiple threads try to access a shared object and when at least one thread modifies it, then we should lock the thread
no need when only one thread present
so need to lock dispatch methodinlift class

waitList comman variable when multiple lifts came to same floor
